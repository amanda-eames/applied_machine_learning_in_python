# Introduction

Terms:

* Feature Representation: a set of techniques that allows a system to automatically discover the representations needed for feature detection or classification from raw data
* Lable: the target value, in classification it is the lable for of an object and regression it is the continuous value
* Training and test set: usually a 75 to 25 split. The training set is used to estimate the parameters of the model, the test set is used to evaulate the model on unseen data. 
* Overfitting: when the increase in the model complexity decreases the performance of the model, no longer captures the global patterns. 
* Underfitting: when the model accuracy would benifit from more complexity. 

Models:

* Classification: the target value is a discrete class value, and in binary classification the target value is 0 (negative class) or 1 (positive class). There is also, multi-class classification where the target value can be a set of discrete values. The third, is multi-label classification where the target value can have multiple assignments. 
* Regression: the target value is a continuous value.
